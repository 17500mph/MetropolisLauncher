# Compiling Metropolis Launcher

You need Visual Studio 2015 or higher (VS14) as well as DevExpress 15.2 (both commercial products *duh*) in order to compile Metropolis Launcher from source.

Anything else is provided in the project on this github.

# Target CPU

Currently, only x86 is supported, you should switch from "Any CPU" to the "x86" profile when compiling.
